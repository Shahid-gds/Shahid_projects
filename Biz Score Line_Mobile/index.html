  <div class="borderline1"></div>
  <div class="dot"></div><br>
  <div class="border-line-key">
    <div class="heading">Corporate profit</div>
  <p>Corporate profit measures profit earned across all industries. 
    A rise in corporate profit generally increases downstream businesses' budgets <br> for consulting services. 
    Therefore, an increase in corporate profit tends to coincide with an increase in industry revenue.
     Corporate profit is <br> expected to increase in 2021, representing a potential opportunity for the industry.</p>
     <div class="heading">Aggregate private investment</div>
     <p>Aggregate private investment includes spending by individuals and businesses on physical structures, equipment and software. An increase <br>
       in investment tends to boost industry revenue, as businesses use consulting services to strategize and plan their investments. For example, <br>
       companies use consultants to understand what aspects of their businesses are most profitable and where investment should be focused. <br>
       Aggregate private investment is expected to increase in 2021.</p>
       <div class="heading">Number of businesses</div>
       <p>Growth in the number of businesses determines the potential market size for management consulting services. An increase in the number of <br>
         businesses expands the pool of possible clientele for management consultants and tends to increase demand for industry services, such as <br>
         administrative, organizational and strategy consulting. The number of businesses is expected to increase in 2021.</p>
         <div class="heading">Government consumption and investment</div>
         <p>Although the corporate sector accounts for the majority of industry revenue, government agencies are responsible for the remainder. <br>
           Industry revenue is linked to government spending via public sector consulting demand. The continued outsourcing of research and <br>
            development contracts has boosted demand from government agencies. Government consumption and investment is expected to increase in 2021.</p>
            <div class="heading">Yield on 10-year Treasury note</div>
            <p>Treasury notes are bonds issued by the federal government to finance federal spending. They are risk-free assets that occupy a central place <br>
               within the financial ecosystem and monetary policy; as a result, when the yield on Treasury notes rises, interest rates on other bonds and <br>
              loans to business also tend to increase, potentially reducing investment and therefore demand for industry services. 
              The yield on 10-year <br> Treasury notes is forecast to increase in 2021, posing a potential threat to the industry.</p>

<section style="background-image: url(assets/img/line-bg2.png );">
  <section id="product" class="product"  >
  <p class="para1">Services offered by the Management Consulting industry are highly diverse and vary based on the size and scale of a given industry operator, the
    background of its employees and its geographic location, among other factors. As a result, diverse service offerings enable many smaller 
    enterprises to capture market share by specializing in a particular field, contributing to the industry's fragmented nature. Moreover, the COVID-19
    (coronavirus) pandemic has affected demand for some industry services more than others.</p>
    <div class="border-line-key">
      <div class="heading">Corporate strategyt</div>
    <p><b>Corporate strategy </b> consulting services include strategic advisory in the areas of general growth strategy, leadership development,
      performance improvement, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and corporate portfolio design. In the area of leadership development,
      consultants view employee engagement as a potential source of competitive advantage. Similarly, new businesses often seek out the 
      services of management consultants to build out executive leader teams, as industry operators frequently maintain connections in the 
      senior recruiting world. Mergers and acquisitions advisory is also a significant source of revenue within this segment. Partnerships, mergers 
      and strategic acquisitions carry a significant amount of uncertainty for the newly formed businesses. Moreover, it may be difficult for 
      companies to assess the likely outcome of M&A activity and to choose the best strategy; mergers also involve logistical and operational  
      challenges that result from integrating companies together. As a result, these companies will contract industry professionals to highlight 
      synergies, illustrate justified divestitures and discuss proper financing options. M&A consultation also represents a countercyclical service  
      offering for the industry, as M&A activity increases during recessions. Amid the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, leadership development 
      expenditure decreased, while M&A advisory expenditure increased. General corporate spending on consulting services has remained 
      relatively strong amid the coronavirus pandemic as consulting firms have been contracted to advise on logistical challenges companies face 
      in adapting to remote work and ramping up the pace of technology integration. As a result, demand from this market segment has
      remained stable over the past five years, representing an estimated 40.9% of industry revenue in 2021.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="border-line-key">
      <div class="heading">Organizational design</div>
    <p><b>Organizational design </b> services are estimated to account for 40.8% of industry revenue in 2021, representing the second-largest
      industry service offering. Organizational design can be broad or narrow depending on the scope of the consulting company, but it  
      generally relates to streamlining business processes and organizational structures in ways that best adhere to clients' lines of business and 
      general needs. As a result, organizational design consulting can take many forms. For instance, a corporation seeking to enter an 
      international market may hire consultants to determine the proper approach to maintain the company's foundational values and branding 
      while adapting to the culture of the foreign market. Additionally, companies that have over-extended product or service portfolios to the 
      point of loss will seek advisory services to divest product or service lines and specialize on their most profitable items. Over the five years to 
      2021, this service segment has increased as a share of revenue as many domestic businesses have sought international expansion.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="border-line-key">
      <div class="heading">Marketing and sales</div>
    <p><b> Marketing and sales </b> services generate an estimated 3.2% of management consulting revenue in 2021. These services are employed in  
      the areas of brand strategy, design, corporate identity and image consulting. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, companies reconsidered  
      existing marketing techniques in light of digital marketing opportunities, raising revenue from this segment. However, amid the coronavirus 
      pandemic, downstream companies have cut spending on advertising, leading this segment to fall as a share of industry revenue over the past five years.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="border-line-key">
      <div class="heading">Financial advisory</div>
    <p><b>Financial advisory </b> services generate an estimated 9.5% of industry revenue in 2021. Consulting firms engaged in financial advisory
      services provide finance and risk management executives, such as CFOs, with financial and economic analyses of the risks and uncertainties 
      their companies face. These uncertainties include business and legal issues that result from changes in demand, public policy, financial 
      conditions, competition and the regulatory environment. Many operators are part of larger accounting firms, giving them the advantage of
      economies of scope in providing financial advisory services. However, many downstream businesses are more likely to consult with 
      operators in the Scientific & Economic Consulting industry (IBISWorld report 54169) on issues specifically related to economic research. This  
      service segment has remained steady as a share of industry revenue over the past five years.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="border-line-key">
      <div class="heading">Process and operations management</div>
    <p><b>Process and operations management </b> services account for an estimated 2.8% of industry revenue in 2021. This service segment 
      includes process, physical distribution and logistics consulting. Under the heading of logistics consulting, production scheduling and supply 
      chain management form a consistent source of revenue for management consultants. Profit-motivated companies seek strategies 
      to generate cost savings and increase operational efficiency. As a result of supply chain issues related to the coronavirus pandemic, demand 
      for supply chain and logistics consulting has increased over the past five years.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="border-line-key">
      <div class="heading">IT strategy</div>
    <p><b>Information technology (IT) strategy </b> advisory services account for an estimated 2.2% of industry revenue in 2021. Although IT 
      consulting is mostly excluded from this industry, being accounted for within the IT Consulting industry (IBISWorld report 54151),
      management consulting operators do provide the following IT solutions: custom computer application design and development services, 
      computer systems design, development and integration services and IT infrastructure management services. In some areas, management 
      consulting firms directly compete with specialist consulting firms in the IT Consulting industry. However, many clients have recognized that 
      review of an organization's structure and technology are part of an integrated process. As a result, management consulting firms  
      increasingly integrate IT strategy into their services, making this a growth area for the industry over the past five years. Relatedly, the 
      coronavirus pandemic has driven an increase in demand for IT-related advisory services due to remote work arrangements and the 
      accelerating digitalization of business processes.</p>

    <p><b>Industry operators </b> also offer HR consulting services, which account for an estimated 0.6% of industry revenue in 2021. HR consulting
      services are primarily accounted for within the HR Consulting industry (IBISWorld report 54161b); as a result, they account for a small share 
      of this industry's revenue. Nonetheless, industry operators offer some HR advisory services, along with broader consulting packages, similar
      to the IT strategy segment.</p>
      <div class="heading"></div><br>
      <p><b>Demand</b> for the Management Consulting industry's services is closely linked to the revenue and budget constraints of downstream 
        business, government and nonprofit clients. As a result, business confidence, corporate profit and government investment and spending 
        are all important factors that collectively determine the revenue performance of this industry.
      </p>
      <div class="heading"></div><br>
      <p><b>Similarly,</b> demand for management consulting services is linked to the business cycle. It is particularly sensitive to business and 
        government activity in areas such as mergers, acquisitions, financial planning, feasibility studies, human resources and strategic planning. 
        Government agencies' hiring of consultants, particularly at the state level, has increased due to the outsourcing of research and  
        development to the private sector. Crises may also precipitate demand from the public sector, as government entities require advisory 
        services to deal with the fallout of unexpected disaster events. For example, the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic led to an increase in  
        demand from government agencies attempting to navigate various challenges related to the pandemic.
      </p>
      <div class="heading"></div><br>
      <p><b>The industry</b> as a whole tends to be procyclical, as downstream businesses cut back spending on consulting services when facing their 
        own budget constraints and declining revenue. In some respects, however, management consulting can be a countercyclical industry, since  
        consulting companies may be hired to improve a company's performance during a downturn. Moreover, companies that exhibit declining  
        performance generally may seek out industry services to effect a strategic pivot that can reposition them for growth. Changing regulations
        may also increase demand for industry services, as downstream businesses may need to shift their business strategies as a result of a  
        shifting regulatory environment.
      </p>
      <div class="heading"></div><br>
      <p><b>Global economic</b> conditions, including changes in clients' particular industries and markets, also affect revenue in the consulting 
        business. Revenue fluctuations are also affected by the introduction of new products, including competing services. For example, disruptive  
        technologies in other industries may stimulate demand for consulting services, which has occurred in recent years due to the ongoing
        adoption of artificial intelligence, cloud computing and related technologies.

          <div class="heading">Financial services companies</div>
        <p><b>Financial service providers </b> constitute one of the largest markets for management consulting services, accounting for an estimated 26.4% of industry revenue in 2021. Financial 
          services companies seek industry services for variety of purposes, ranging from strategic planning to organizational restructuring. Major international banks, for example, 
          employ management consultants to streamline operations and maintain profit levels. However, management consultants advise on all major financial services areas, including  
          retail banking, asset management,payments systems, capital markets and risk management. Increasingly, finance consulting overlaps with alternative data providers as 
          institutional investors seek insights driven by data mining to enhance their investment theses. Similarly, finance consulting may overlap with investment research more broadly. 
          Demand from this sector has grown in line with the increasing adoption of new technologies by financial services companies, including cloud technologies and artificial
          intelligence. Moreover, amid the coronavirus pandemic, financial services firms engaged industry services to manage risks related to the pandemic and the substantial effects it 
          had on their portfolios.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-line-key">
          <div class="heading">Consumer products and hospitality</div>
        <p><b>The consumer products </b> market segment engages industry services for branding and logistics consulting, as retail sales and distribution are significant factors for businesses in
          the segment. For example, typical customers in this market include wholesalers, retailers and distributors in industries that produce commodities such as apparel and household 
          goods. Consumer product businesses may seek consulting in relation to growing e-commerce penetration, changing demographics and consumption patterns, evolving 
          branding practices and marketing strategies.Manufacturers may engage consultants to develop more-efficient production techniques or implement new production technologies.</p>
          <p>Hospitality markets include restaurants and food services; hotels and other accommodation businesses; and airline transportation. For food and accommodation customers, 
            the consulting may relate to labor management, since employee compensation typically represents the most significant operating expense for such businesses. Similarly, product
            development, marketing  research and organizational structure consulting services are popular among these clients. These operators also seek advisory services related to
            branding and marketing. Amid the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, demand for hospitality services shifted toward durable goods consumption due to social distancing measures.  
            As a result, the increase in consumer products demand somewhat offset declining hospitality demand. Moreover, in 2021, as social distancing measures are eased, hospitality  demand 
            is expected to increase; relatedly, consultants have been hired by  hospitality businesses to navigate the business landscape associated with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. 
            As a result, demand from this segment has remained stable over the past five years, accounting for an estimated 22.8% of industry revenue in 2021.</p>

          <div class="heading">Government organizations</div>
        <p><b>Government organizations </b> account for an estimated 13.8% of industry revenue in 2021. Management consultants are hired by federal, state and local government agencies to advise
          on methods to  better administer grants, deliver benefits and entitlements to employees and provide necessary services to citizenry. Consultants also advise on public projects, such 
          as infrastructure development and public-private partnerships. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, demand from government agencies has increased as a share of industry revenue 
          as government entities have sought out consulting services related to containing the spread of the novel coronavirus and other related issues. For example, major player McKinsey
          and Company was reported to have been awarded at least $100.0 million in government contracts from several agencies in 2020 related to the coronavirus pandemic. Relatedly,
          Bain and Company, a major consultancy, reports that it works closely with national and regional  governments, in addition to government-owned companies. As a result, this segment 
          has increased as a share of industry revenue over the past five years.</p>

        <p><b>This market segment</b> accounts for an estimated 11.5% of annual industry revenue in 2021. Customers in this market segment hire management consultants to advise on business 
          strategy in relation to information technology, including telecommunications and digital media. Telecommunications is a rapidly changing field that is strongly influenced by technological 
          change. As businesses increasingly move operations online, many have hired consultants to assist in the adoption and integration of novel, digital technologies. In recent years,
          digital technologies have changed many existing business processes, resulting in companies seeking expert advice in how to respond and take advantage of such technologies. For  
          example, growth in consulting related to cloud technologies and big data has increased demand from this market segment over the past five years. Moreover, amid the coronavirus  
          pandemic, remote work conditions and an acceleration in the percentage of business conducted online have increased demand from this segment further.</p>

          For example, ongoing changes in  information technology related to medical billing services have increased demand for operational and IT consulting from this market segment. Demand  
          from companies in this market segment has also increased as a result of enhanced public and private investment to combat the coronavirus pandemic. In 2021, higher healthcare services

    <h1>Basis of Competition</h1>
    <div class="borderline1"></div>
    <div class="dot"></div><br>
    <p>The Management Consulting industry is composed of companies with the skills, expertise and flexibility to meet the needs of a variety of clients with 
      varying budgets and objectives. Given the high level of competition for large consulting projects and the importance of repeat business, there is a 
      strong emphasis placed not just on the quality of the insights provided, but also on generating tangible results in a cost-effective manner.</p>
    <div class="border-line-key">
      <div class="heading">Internal competition</div>
    <p>Before submitting a bid, a management consulting firm has already submitted a crucial component of its offer for scrutiny: its reputation. 
      Over time, a management consultancy develops a record of successes or failures in terms of the results of its advice to clients. It is this
       reputation, substantiated by past client performance against the performance of client industry benchmarks, that is the biggest selling point 
       for management consultancies, particularly large industry players. This makes ongoing success in providing actionable and effective solutions
        for clients an imperative for operators.</p> <br>
        <p>Increasingly, management consulting firms advertise themselves as one-stop shops, boasting an ability to provide insights and implementation 
          strategies for the entire range of needs for large, complex corporations. In this area, consolidation among top firms evidences a race among 
          consulting firms to expand service offerings through acquisitions and mergers. Simultaneously, small and large firms both compete for niche
           markets, promoting industry-specific expertise and experience in a particular set of topics important to management, such as corporate strategy, 
           human resources and logistics. For example, small operators may be highly knowledgeable in a specific niche and compete to win contracts in that
           area of expertise, while large firms may hire highly experienced experts in that area with strong business acumen to compete in the same niche 
           market and complement their broader offerings.
        </p> <br>
        <p>Increasing globalization in the industry has occurred alongside the expansion of both industry operators and their clients internationally. 
          Like other industries in the sector, such as the Public Relations Firms industry (IBISWorld report 54182), industry operators have expanded the
           international scope of their offerings and expertise to better serve large, downstream multinational corporations that require complex operational
            and strategic advisory services across their geographic verticals. As a result, internal competition in the industry is predicated on servicing 
            the specific needs of clients at a given point in time; this is because the economic and business trends of emerging markets and developed 
            economies that operators and their clients conduct business are always subject to change based on a variety of considerations and influences.
             Similarly, the range of advisory services offered has responded to client needs, with large advisory firms, such as McKinsey and Company, 
             increasing their offerings of technology-related advisory services, including data analytics and information technology. Competition in the
              technology consulting field is extremely high due to the high number of dynamic, evolving technologies that are currently transforming 
              business practices across all sectors, including artificial intelligence, cloud computing, 3D printing and the internet of things.
        </p><br>
        <p>Although the largest industry operators account for less than 5.0% of industry revenue, the industry's major firms benefit from economies of 
          scale in marketing and service distribution, giving them a greater capacity to serve clients across the country and win high-value contracts.
          Small- and medium-size firms, however, may have lower overhead costs, enabling them to provide a high-quality service at a lower cost. 
          Furthermore, small consultancy firms have greater flexibility and may undertake consultancies at a strategic loss to establish a hold 
          within a particular consulting area.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="border-line-key">
      <div class="heading">External competition</div>
    <p>As a result of the push to train specialist consultants in a variety of fields, competition has recently increased from firms in other 
      industries, especially in the information technology (IT), finance and human resource areas. For example, the services provided by the IT
       Consulting industry (IBISWorld report 54151) have increasingly overlapped with the services offered by this industry because IT has become
        more relevant to management, production and logistics strategy. Use of the terminology "managed services," which encapsulates the merging 
        of advisory and implementation services, is growing. In fact, Accenture is considered one of the largest players in both the management 
        consulting and IT consulting fields.</p> <br>
        <p>In addition to competition from other consulting firms external to the industry, the Accounting Services industry (54121c) has emerged 
          as a significant competitor to traditional management consultants. Consulting services represent the top-performing segment for each of 
          the Accounting Services industry's major players. Many of the industry's largest firms are transitioning into full-service consulting 
          providers, as this higher-margin, less-competitive service offers more growth potential than traditional audit and assurance practices.</p>

    <h1>Capital Intensity</h1>
    <div class="borderline1"></div>
    <div class="dot"></div><br>
    <p>As a services industry, Management Consulting is characterized by a low level of capital intensity. IBISWorld estimates that for every $1.00 spent on labor,
       industry operators will allocate $0.02 toward capital investment in 2021. Over the five years to 2021, industry capital intensity has remained stable as 
       average depreciation expenses have remained steady as a share of industry revenue. Despite wage costs increasing from an estimated 39.7% to 48.5% of 
       industry revenue over the past five years, industry capital intensity has remained constant. Total wage costs in this industry are high, primarily due 
       to the advanced level of education, skill and experience required for industry employees. Furthermore, a premium is paid for consultants with a name, 
       reputation and professional network that will draw business to a firm; contracts can be won or lost if a certain expert enters or departs a company. 
       The consulting process is very personalized and a firm's most respected consultants are often requested by name.
    </p> <br>
        <p>Since the majority of industry expenditures are allocated toward wage costs rather than the purchase of equipment, depreciation of capital assets represents 
          only an estimated 0.8% of industry revenue in 2021. Capital intensity within the Management Consulting Industry is relatively low compared with the sector-wide 
          average. Though still labor-intensive, other industries in the sector, including the Environmental Consulting Services and Scientific and Economic 
          Consulting Services industries (IBISWorld reports 54162 and 54169, respectively), have a relatively greater reliance on costly scientific equipment, 
          resulting in a higher proportion of capital inputs to production. In contrast, management consulting firms' capital investments are largely limited to 
          the computer programs and networking and computer hardware necessary to conduct analysis and communicate with clients. Operators also make depreciable 
          investments on improvements to properties; however, these do not constitute a large percentage of overall revenue.</p>
